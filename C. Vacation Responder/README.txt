All files are placed in 'Responder' folder

The Responder is able to check unread emails from Gmail.com using API

For running it in your PC, You need to put new credential file in the 'gm' folder instead of 'credentials.json'
During the development I used my personla credentials for testing.

Label for checking of emails in gmail can be specified in 'usr_data.py'
User's email must be placed in 'checker.py'
